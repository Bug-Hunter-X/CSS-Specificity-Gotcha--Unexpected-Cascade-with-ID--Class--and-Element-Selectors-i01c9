Several solutions exist to resolve this CSS specificity issue. Here's one example:

1. **Improve selector specificity:** The main issue is related to the last rule's selector and the unexpected behavior. Developers should avoid such complex selectors to reduce unexpected behaviors.

2. **Rewrite the CSS:** One method is to improve the CSS structure and improve readability with more targeted selectors.  One way is to break down the more specific selector to improve clarity. 

3. **Use !important (Use cautiously):** As a last resort, the `!important` flag can be used to force a specific style to be applied. However, overuse of `!important` can make CSS maintenance difficult.  It's recommended to avoid it whenever possible and resolve issues using other, more maintainable solutions. 

Here's the improved CSS:

```css
div {
  color: blue; /* Default color */
}

.special-class div {
  color: red; /* Style for divs within elements having class special-class*/
}

#very-specific-id {
  color: green; /* Style for the element with id very-specific-id */
}

#very-specific-id.special-class {
  color: purple; /* Style when the element with id very-specific-id also has class special-class*/
}

/* Remove conflicting selector and use more specific selectors */
```

This improved structure reduces the risk of unexpected specificity issues and clarifies the intent.
