The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.special-class div {
  color: red;
}

#very-specific-id {
  color: green;
}

#very-specific-id.special-class {
  color: purple;
}

#very-specific-id.special-class div {
  color: yellow;
} 
```

The issue lies in the unexpected behavior when combining ID selectors, class selectors, and element selectors. In this case, the final rule (`#very-specific-id.special-class div`) overrides all previous rules despite the higher specificity of some earlier rules.  The `yellow` color might unexpectedly not show if the developer expects `purple` or `green` due to the unexpected order of cascading specificity rules.  This can create difficult-to-debug situations where the most specific selector doesn't appear to win.
